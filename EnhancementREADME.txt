===Enhancment Documentation===
The Enhancement I have created as a chat system for the staff so they can communciate
if 1 of them is unsure on what to do or what the results they have avaliabl mean
in case they need a second opinion.

How to use the enhancement:
First of all make sure the staff frontend is running and so is the 
applications backend.
To do this navigate into the files labeled 'backend' and 'frontend_staff' on the command prompt

Once here run the command 'npm start' in both terminals to run both the frontend
and server for the application. 

Once these are both running, we can navigate to the chat system.
Log in to the system or if you don't have a log in yet navigate to register and create an account

Once you have logged in you will see a link in the header about 'Medical Staff Chat Room'.

Once you press this link, Enter you username for the chat room and the room you want to join in the 
corrisponding input fields.

Once you have done this press 'Join'.

Once you press join it should navigate you to the chat room. From here you can enter messages in the inout field at the bottom
and press send. This will send the message to the chat room.

Any other user that is part of the chat room then will be able to see that message and
respond to it from their end of the chat room
